			<div class="accordion__answer">
				<p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are programming languages that are used to create web pages. HTML provides the structure and content of a web page, while CSS controls the visual design and layout. HTML uses tags to surround content, such as Welcome to Simplilearn. CSS uses selectors followed by a declaration mark, such as `header{ background-color: green; }`.
