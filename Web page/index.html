                    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are three basic web technologies used in modern web development:
HTML
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language that defines the structure of a website and the hierarchy of its content. HTML tags are read by browsers and displayed to users.
CSS
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style language that controls the layout and display of web pages. CSS can make HTML more user-friendly by adding visual appeal and styles like colors and fonts.
JavaScript
JavaScript is a scripting language that adds dynamic behavior to a website, such as animations and interactive features. JavaScript is a runtime language for web browsers, so when a web page loads, the browser will load both the standard JavaScript that comes with the page and any additional JavaScript that has been added.

                    C++ is a general-purpose, high-level programming language used to build software. It's an object-oriented language, which means it focuses on using data fields with unique attributes, called objects, instead of logic or functions. For example, a user account on a website is an object that typically includes data like first name, last name, and email address.

                Java has been one of the most popular
                programming language for many years.
                Java is Object Oriented. However it is
                not considered as pure object oriented
                as it provides support for primitive
                data types (like int, char, etc) The
                Java codes are first compiled into byte
                code (machine independent code). Then
                the byte code is run on Java Virtual
                Machine (JVM) regardless of the
                underlying architecture.
